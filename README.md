# Translating-the-Left

This simple (beginner) extension is a **JOKE**.
It has been created after a silly suggestion to translate the hyperbolic language seen online. 
This extension allows a user to add a list of words which will automatically be changed to ("Bad Thing"), after a page fully loads. 
It is a free and open-source extension for anyone to use or adapt. Have fun, laugh more, and love others.
Feel free to check out @CrazyCanadia online.

**This is a simple extension for JOKE purposes only.**
